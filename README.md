This repository contains a hybrid script that allows you to retrieve OSPF neighbors state for IPv4 (default) and/or IPv6.

Note: By default the hybrid_neighbors() function allows you to retrieve by default the state of OSPF neighbors for IPv4, to modify in case of IPv6Â in the last line of the script hybrid_neighbors(R1, 'ipv6').

Here the link to Cisco Community blog on it: https://community.cisco.com/t5/networking-blogs/a-hybrid-way-to-get-ospf-neighbors-state-ipv4-and-or-ipv6/ba-p/5036671
