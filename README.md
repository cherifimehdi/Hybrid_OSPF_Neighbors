This repository contains a hybrid script that allows you to retrieve OSPF neighbors state for IPv4 (default) and/or IPv6.

Note: By default the hybrid_neighbors() function allows you to retrieve by default the state of OSPF neighbors for IPv4, to modify in case of IPv6Â in the last line of the script hybrid_neighbors(R1, 'ipv6').
